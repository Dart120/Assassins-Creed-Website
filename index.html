                    Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth video game 
                    franchise created by Patrice Desilets, Jade Raymond and Corey May, 
                    developed and published by Ubisoft using the game engine Anvil and 
                    its more advanced derivatives. It depicts a centuries-old struggle, 
                    now and then, between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, 
                    and the Templars, who desire peace through control.

            The first Assassin's Creed introduced core elements that remained in the rest of the game series. 
            The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of Masyaf (the Brotherhood's location), Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus, 
            and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system,
            free running, climbing, stealth, parkour, and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete 
            a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this 
            side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.

            Assassin's Creed 2 (2009)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the first game, Assassin's Creed II takes place in historical 
            recreations of Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside, 
            and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided 
            into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points 
            in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach 
            to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni 
            villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding 
            buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate 
            wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests 
            involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by "Subject 16", a former Animus user, 
            that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.

            Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (2010)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary 
            focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. 
            Ezio can freely explore 16th-century Rome to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. 
            The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a Templar training program.

        <p>
            Assassin's Creed: Revelations is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with 
            a primary focus on using Ezio's, Desmond's, and Altaïr's combat 
            and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. 
            One of the protagonists (Ezio) is free to explore the Assassin Base in the city of Constantinople 
            and the city itself to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.

            Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective 
            with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate 
            targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, 
            and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a 
            multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team-based objectives including 
            assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based 
            exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the 
            series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth 
            system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. 
            The game's setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, 
            and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option 
            to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration 
            is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures 
            from a Spanish fleet.
